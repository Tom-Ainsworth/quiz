          So you've come to find out which house you'll be in when you get to Hogwarts?
          <br>
          <br>
          Well there are a few things you might want to know before you commit to this fine school of Witchcraft &
          Wizardry...
        </p>
        <!-- List of Instructions -->
        <ul>
          <li>
            As you may have noticed, this is an instructions page on how to find the Hogwarts House most suited to
            you. To begin, return to the Main Menu, and press "Start Quiz".
          </li>
          <li>
            Now you have started the magical process of finding the right house, you must choose the answer that most
            fits your personality.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure you are happy with your answer, then press the submit button. The hat will remember your answer
            and then move onto the next question.
          </li>
          <li>
            Picked the wrong answer? Fear not! You can press the Start Again button to cast an Obliviate spell on the
            hat, making it forget your answers and returning you to the Main Menu so you can try again.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you come to the of the sorting process, the Sorting Hat will display a message indicating which house
            you are suited to, and show you which colour robes you will be wearing to Hogwarts. Congratulations!
          </li>
          <li>
            If you think the hat has made a mistake, or you aren't happy with the result, you can return to the Main
            Menu and try again using different answers. Remember, even Harry Potter was supposed to be a Slytherin
            before he chose Gryffindor!
          </li>
        </ul>
